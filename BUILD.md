## Using Dev Containers

This repository includes Dev Containers configuration for a quick development environment setup. For general information about Dev Containers, see the [official guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).

The dev container automatically sets up:
- A local YDB database instance for testing
- YDB CLI with a pre-configured profile named `local` that connects to the database
- All Python dependencies and development tools
